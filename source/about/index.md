## I am a Data Scientist 

Always, since as long as I can remember, I have found myself captivated by the beauty of what a computer does, and I have always wanted to understand it, be part of it and Innovate.

I have started my journey in Computer Science as a self-taught, using online courses and various books. The road was a bit rough taking in account english was not my first language. Then after getting my Mathematics High School Degree, I chose to continue my studies in a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Sciences at the University Of Ibn Zohr, the Faculty of Science in Agadir.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Research Degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence applied to Computer Vision, Signal Processing, and Natural Language Processing.
